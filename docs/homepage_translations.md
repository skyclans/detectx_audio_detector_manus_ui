## Section 2: DetectX Audio (Core)

| Key | English |
|-----|---------|
| core.title | DetectX Audio |
| core.paragraph_1 | DetectX Audio is a dual-engine forensic verification system designed to detect AI-generated music while protecting human artists. |
| core.paragraph_2 | The system uses Enhanced Mode by default: Classifier Engine (primary) trained on 30,000,000+ verified human music samples, combined with Reconstruction Engine (secondary) for additional AI signal analysis. |
| core.paragraph_3 | By analyzing structural patterns unique to AI-generated audio, DetectX Audio reports whether AI signal evidence is present while maintaining near-zero false positives on human music. |
| core.principles_title | Key Principles |
| core.principle_1 | Dual-engine verification (Classifier + Reconstruction) |
| core.principle_2 | Human-safe by design (98.89% accuracy on human music) |
| core.principle_3 | Strong AI detection |
| core.principle_4 | Clear binary verdict, no probability scores |

## Section 3: How It Works

| Key | English |
|-----|---------|
| howitworks.title | How It Works |
| howitworks.step_1 | Audio is processed through the Classifier Engine (CNN). |
| howitworks.step_2 | If classifier score exceeds 90%, Reconstruction Engine activates. |
| howitworks.step_3 | Audio is separated into stems and reconstructed for comparison. |
| howitworks.step_4 | Dual-engine consensus determines the final verdict. |
| howitworks.note | Enhanced Mode prioritizes human protection: if the Classifier Engine says "Human," it is trusted. Additional analysis only runs when AI signals are initially detected. |

---

## Section 4: Clear Verdict Semantics

| Key | English |
|-----|---------|
| verdict.title | Clear Verdict Semantics |
| verdict.intro | DetectX Audio reports only two possible outcomes: |
| verdict.outcome_1 | AI signal evidence was observed. |
| verdict.outcome_2 | AI signal evidence was not observed. |
| verdict.disclaimer | These statements describe structural signal behavior only. They do not imply authorship, probability, creative intent, or legal attribution. |

## Section 5: Mid-Page CTA

| Key | English |
|-----|---------|
| midcta.title | Verify your music |
| midcta.description | Upload your audio file and get instant AI detection results. Enhanced Mode provides dual-engine verification with strong AI detection and 98.89% human accuracy. |
| midcta.button | Verify Audio |

## Section 6: Protecting Human Creativity

| Key | English |
|-----|---------|
| protect.title | Protecting Human Creativity |
| protect.paragraph_1 | DetectX Audio was developed to protect human artists from being falsely flagged as AI-generated. |
| protect.paragraph_2 | With 98.89% accuracy on human music, our Classifier Engine is trained on over 30 million verified human music samples to understand the full spectrum of human musical expression. |
| protect.paragraph_3 | DetectX does not determine authorship. It provides a reliable verification reference that prioritizes human artist protection while maintaining strong AI detection. |
